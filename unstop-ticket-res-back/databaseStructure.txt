Database Connection:
The code establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.

The connection URI is obtained from the environment variable process.env.MONGODB_URI or defaults to 'mongodb://localhost:27017/seatReservation'.

Mongoose connects to the MongoDB server with the specified URI, enabling communication between the Node.js application and the database.
Seat Model:
The application requires the Seat model from the ./models/seat.js file.
The Seat model represents the schema and behavior of a seat entity in the MongoDB database.
The model defines the structure of a seat document and provides methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting seat records in the database.
The schema includes fields such as number (seat number), available (availability status), and id.
Initial Seat Data:
The createInitialSeats function is called after establishing a successful connection to the MongoDB database.
It performs the following tasks:
Deletes any existing seat data in the Seat collection using Seat.deleteMany().
Creates new seat data by inserting documents based on the seatNumbers array, which is imported from ./seatNumbers.js, using Seat.create().
The seatNumbers array contains predefined seat numbers or details for initializing the seat data in the database.
API Endpoints:
The code defines two API endpoints using Express routes.
GET /api/seats:
Retrieves all seat documents from the Seat collection using Seat.find() and returns them as a JSON response.
This endpoint allows clients to fetch the current state of all seats in the database.
POST /api/reservations:
Accepts a request body containing an array of seatNumbers that represents the requested seat numbers for reservation.
Validates the input and checks if the requested seats are available by querying the Seat collection using Seat.find().
If all requested seats are available, the endpoint updates the corresponding seat documents to mark them as reserved using Seat.updateMany().
Sends a JSON response indicating the success or failure of the reservation attempt.
Error Handling Middleware:
The application includes an error handling middleware that catches any errors thrown during the request processing.
If an error occurs, it logs the error message and returns a 500 Internal Server Error response to the client.
Server Initialization:
The application listens for incoming connections on port 8000 using app.listen().
When the server starts, it logs a message indicating the port number.
